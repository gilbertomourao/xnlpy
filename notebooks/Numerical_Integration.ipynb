    "# Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Integration is a very important field inside numerical analysis. It is widely used in engineering to deal with very complicated data, such as transient analysis in a power system. **XNLPY** have the function integral, which is capable of dealing with analytic functions that neather have a closed form integral on a certain interval nor can be integrated easily. In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how this function works applying it to three complicated integrals and talk about it's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of algorithms capable of give the numerical value of a definite integral. **XNLPY**'s integral function make use of an adaptive quadrature method that uses the Gauss-Legendre points to approximate the value given a certain tolerance and a certain depth. That is, given a function f integrable at the interval (a,b) and n Gauss-Legendre points, the integral can be approximated by the Equation 1.\n",

    "\\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx \\approx \\frac{b-a}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i f\\left(\\frac{b-a}{2}x_i + \\frac{b+a}{2}\\right)\n",
    "\\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will then use this approximation at certain intervals to reach the required tolerance or until it reaches the depth provided by the user. Here it's valid to warn you that a very large depth and a very small tolerance can make the function stall. Another thing to notice is that for more points the final value will have more precision, but that's not always the case. Some functions have very irregular shape and using less points will make the approximation on tiny intervals better."

    "In this tutorial we'll use three complicated integrals with known closed form to measure the true error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, import the modules xnlpy and math and the function default_timer from timeit. The last is used to measure the performance of the integral function. Since we're going to measure time, it's good to create a function that executes the integral function a determined number of times and then return the mean time and the standard deviation. This can be done very easily with the statistics module."
